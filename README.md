Trimou - Trim Your Mustache Templates!
======

Trimou is a Mustache implementation written in Java. Since 1.5.0 Trimou has a helper API inspired by Handlebars. The goal is to provide a simple to use and easy to extend templating engine for any Java SE or Java EE application. So far there are five ready-to-use extensions which provide integration with CDI, Servlets, PrettyTime, HtmlCompressor and google-gson.
